mgdiff (1.0-20) unstable; urgency=low

  * applied lots of patches from Erik de Castro Lopo <erikd AT mega-nerd DOT
    com> (explanations from his e-mail to me):
    - mgdiff-includes.diff: Fix a couple of missing includes.
    - mgdiff-islatin.diff: Fix a warning message.
    - mgdiff-sun-fix.diff: A fix for SUN Solaris.
    - mgdiff-tempfile.diff: Replace use of tempnam() with something more
      secure.
    - mgdiff-warnings.diff: Remove compiler warnings when using CFLAGS equal
      to -g -O2 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -Wmissing-prototypes [eb: added the
      flags to the Imakefile].
    - mgdiff-snprintf.diff: Replace all usage of sprintf() with snprintf().
    - mgdiff-save-left-right.diff: Add file menu entries for "Save as Left..."
      and "Save as Right...". Includes increment of APP_DEFAULTS_VERSION
      number, mods to Mgdiff.ad and checks for correct app-default value.
    - mgdiff-save-unselected.diff: Allow saving files with unselected blocks.
    - mgdiff-select-both.diff: Add ability to select both sides by clicking
      with the middle button. When both sides are selected the two blocks are
      written to the output file using markings similar to the markings CVS
      palces in a file when a merge goes wrong.
    - mgdiff-man.diff: Update the man page to reflect the above changes. Also
      added my own copyright to a couple of files where I made anything more
      than minor changes. I'm quite happy to have my changes under the same
      license as the original code.

 -- Ian Zimmerman <itz@speakeasy.org>  Fri, 15 Feb 2002 12:38:38 -0800

mgdiff (1.0-17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed not being able to specify the cvsmgdiff gui from the command
    line.  There is now a -g flag.
  * Also fixed a problem with where mgdiff was not comming up when
    the -r option was used exactly once on the command line.

 -- Paul Serice <paul@serice.net>  Tue,  5 Feb 2002 13:09:08 -0600

mgdiff (1.0-16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Better dependencies in the Debian "control" file.
  * Introduced the "cvsmgdiff" script for comparing a revision in your
    CVS archive with what is currently checked out or for comparing
    two revision both of which are in the archive.  It works with
    "mgdiff" (of course), xdiff, xxdiff, and tkdiff (not that tkdiff
    needs this script).
  * Portable way to move rmgdiff.awk out of /usr/bin and into
    /usr/lib/rmgdiff where it should have been in the first place.

mgdiff (1.0-15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debian QA Upload.
  * New version built by Paul Serice <paul@serice.net>
    Fri, 26 Oct 2001 03:19:15 -0500; Thank you for your contribution:
    - This is getting embarrassing. Previous version introduced a bug
      that caused the "only in" sanity check to be triggered (yes,
      again) when a file was only in one directory but had a minimum
      depth of 2.

    Fri, 21 Sep 2001 01:29:06 -0500; Thanks Paul:
    - Merged patch from Polish(ed) distribution, closes: #96085
      (mgdiff has wrong heuristics for determining whether a file is
      text or not).
    - rmgdiff failed to escape meta-characters in directory names causing
      directories like "c++_src" to trigger a sanity check.
